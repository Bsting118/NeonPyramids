# NeonPyramids
Repository containing the main CSS driver code for rendering my animated 3D neon pyramid(s)!

## About
This is a little fun coding challenge I devised to try and practice my graphics programming in an HTML context. 
Nothing too complex here, just some styled DIV panels arranged in such a way that it renders a 3D pyramid object.

## To Preview:
In order to test out this project, first clone the repo. onto your local PC. Then, 
run a live-server test of the HTML file. Personally, I use Visual Studio Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, where
you can press the "Go Live" button directly at the bottom of the IDE's toolbar.
