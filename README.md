# NeonPyramids
Repository containing the main CSS driver code for rendering my animated 3D neon pyramid(s)!

## About
This is a little fun coding challenge I devised to try and practice my graphics programming in an HTML context. 
Nothing too complex here, just some styled DIV panels arranged in such a way that it renders a 3D pyramid object.
