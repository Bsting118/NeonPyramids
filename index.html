<!--TO RUN: 
    1. Start a Live Server, either using terminal with Node or using a VS Code extension.
        -Tip: I used Ritwick Dey's Live Server extension, enabled globally in my VS Code.
    2. Navigate to the opened browser and you should see the neon pyramid!
    3. Right-click on the site and click "Inspect" to view the DOM properties of how it works.
        -Tip: you can change CSS properties, like the color of the pyramid, via editing the inspected DOM!
